        About
      </h1>
      <p>
        An early metric of a video's popularity was the so-called Billion-View
        Club, denoting videos which had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion
        views since their initial upload.The majority of these videos in the
        Billion-View Club have been commercial music videos by popular artists,
        but the list has included oddities, typically programs aimed at
        children.
      </p>

        Although the most-viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as
        "Evolution of Dance" and "Charlie Bit My Finger", the most-viewed videos
        were increasingly related to music videos. Since Lady Gaga's "Bad
        Romance" in 2009, every video that has reached the top of the
        "most-viewed YouTube videos" list has been a music video. Some of the
        previously most-viewed videos are no longer available on the site.

        YouTube tends to be perceived as the domain of insipid vloggers, pranks
        gone awry, and TV clips. But the truth is, the most popular videos on
        the site are overwhelmingly music videos. A look at the top 25
        most-viewed YouTube videos reveals that nearly all of them are recent
        music videos.

        With numerous videos readily clearing one billion views by 2018, more
        interest has been on two and three-billion views and higher metrics. In
        May 2014, "Gangnam Style" became the first video to exceed two billion
        views. "Despacito" became the first video to reach three billion views
        in August 2017, four billion in October 2017, five billion in April
        2018, six billion in February 2019, and seven billion in October
        2020. "Baby Shark Dance" became the first video to reach eight billion
        views in February 2021, nine billion views in July 2021, and ten billion
        views in January 2022.
